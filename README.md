# CSCE 2110 Program3 - Undirected Graph

This program takes in two data files, graph.txt and commands.txt, and makes a undirected graph

# Graph.txt
Graph.txt is supposed to contain nodes where the first node is being added per line and the nodes after it are connected. 

Graph.txt provides the initial state of this graph

# Commands.txt
Commands.txt lists out commands that change the graph

These commands include:
  1. addnode - adds a node to the graph if it doesn't exist
  2. deletenode - deletes a node from the graph if it exists
  3. addedge - adds a connection between two existing nodes
  4. deleteedge - deletes a connection between two existing nodes
